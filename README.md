This GitHub project contains source code, downloadable PDFs, graphics, and additional files for the projects in the 4th edition of ***Head First C#**: A Learner's Guide to Real-World Programming with C# and .NET Core* (O'Reilly Media 2023).

## Work in progress!

We are currently revising the book, which is planned for publication near the end of 2023. We're really excited about it! We'll post a preview of the first four chapters later in the summer. If you're a 4th edition reader, watch this space—we'll post all of the new material in the 5th edition as free PDFs so you can stay up to date without having to buy a new copy of the book.

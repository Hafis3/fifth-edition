![](Images/Head_First_CSharp_cover_glasses.png)

This GitHub project contains source code, downloadable PDFs, graphics, and additional files for the projects in the 4th edition of ***Head First C#**: A Learner's Guide to Real-World Programming with C# and .NET Core* (O'Reilly Media 2023).

## Work in progress!

We are currently revising the book, which is planned for publication near the end of 2023. We're really excited about it! We'll post a preview of the first four chapters later in the summer. If you're a 4th edition reader, watch this space—we'll post all of the new material in the 5th edition as free PDFs so you can stay up to date without having to buy a new copy of the book.

## MAUI Project Preview

One of the most exciting additions to Head First C# is the inclusion of .NET MAUI, Microsoft's new cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. You can find early release versions of the projects in the [MAUI_Projects folder](MAUI_Projects/), and code for the projects in the [Code folder](Code/).

## Unity Labs

Welcome to your first Head First C# Unity Lab. Writing code is a skill, and like any other skill, getting better at it takes practice and experimentation. Unity will be a really valuable tool for that.

Unity is a cross-platform game development tool that you can use to make professional-quality games, simulations, and more. It’s also a fun and satisfying way to get practice with the C# tools and ideas you’ll learn throughout this book. We designed these short, targeted labs to reinforce the concepts and techniques you just learned to help you hone your C# skills. These labs valuable practice, even if you aren’t planning to write games in C#.

You can download early release PDFs of the Unity Labs from the [Unity Labs folder](Unity_Labs/).
